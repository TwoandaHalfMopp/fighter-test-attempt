Attempt at making a fighting game in godot. I had most of the stuff working to some extent, but I consider this project obsolete as it wasn't built with networking support in mind. Leaving it up here for other people to study

Uses derkork's State Charts addon (https://github.com/derkork/godot-statecharts), can also be found on the asset library(https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1778)
